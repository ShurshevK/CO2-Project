A transparency-first carbon footprint calculator for quickly estimating your personal carbon footprint.

The project is written in typescript, the frontend in Vue 3. 

An interactive installation invites visitors to find out how much greenhouse gases they are emitting into the air, which they calculate with a few questions on the website of CO2 Calculator. Visitors can also see in real time what their carbon footprint really looks like in a balloon in daily volume. The balloon that is inflated visualizes the physical volume of greenhouse gases, in carbon dioxide equivalent, emitted into the air daily by an individual. This gives each person the opportunity to see what the true scale of his or her pollution looks like. The installation then offers a website with ways a person can offset their carbon footprint.
